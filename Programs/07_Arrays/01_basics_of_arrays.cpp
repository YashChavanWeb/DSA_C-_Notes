// Basics of arrays
/*
- should only contain same data type elements
- indexing starts from 0 and goes till n-1 (size is n)
- declaring array in main
    -- max size is 10^6
    -- all indexes assigned with garbage value
- declaring array in global
    -- max size is 10^7
    -- all indexes are assigned with 0
- array is stored into memory
    -- first index is stored at a random memory address
    -- and then the next locations are contiguous memory locations
